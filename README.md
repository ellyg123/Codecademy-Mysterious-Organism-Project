# Codecademy Mysterious Organism Project
> Creates JS objects that simulate the DNA of *P. aequor* for researchers to study.
## General Information
  * Simulates high rate of mutation in *P. aequor*'s DNA, creates random DNA array and chooses elements by random to mutate
  * Estimates if the strand will likely survive based on percentage of 'D' and 'G' bases
## Technologies Used
  * JavaScript
## Acknowledgments
  * Created using this [tutorial.](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-javascript-syntax-part-ii/modules/fecp-challenge-project-mysterious-organism/projects/mysterious-organism)
